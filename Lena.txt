Hello Lena! Good luck on your studies!

1.) Write a Java program to swap the value of two int variables, if the first number is 10 and the second number is 10.
	Before swap : Num1 = 11 
				  Num2 = 22

	Answer swap : Num1 = 22
				: Num2 = 11

Answer: 


2.) Given an array like below, please print out this message:
	"LENA!"
	String[] letters = {"K","E","N","A","!"};

	*hint*(loop)

Answer:


3.) Print all the numbers that are divisible by 4 from 1-100

	*hint*(loop)

Answer: 


4.) Given a string, return a new string made of 3 copies of the first 2 chars of the original string. The string may be any length. If there are fewer than 2 chars, use whatever is there.


extraFront("Hello") → "HeHeHe"
extraFront("ab") → "ababab"
extraFront("H") → "HHH"

Answer: 
public String extraFront(String str) {


5.) Ask user to enter 4 numbers ( use Scanner), and then tell them which number of the four is bigger

Answer:


6.) Given two non-negative int values, return true if they have the same last digit, such as with 27 and 57. Note that the % "mod" operator computes remainders, so 17 % 10 is 7.


lastDigit(7, 17) → true
lastDigit(6, 17) → false
lastDigit(3, 113) → true

Answer: 
public boolean lastDigit(int a, int b) {
